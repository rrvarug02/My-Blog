## Description
This project is a simple, two-page personal blog website that allows users to create and view blog posts. It includes a content form, multiple pages, and a light/dark mode toggle feature. This website was completely built from nothing to start with. I also used local storage and jQuery to create certain HTML elements. 

## User Usage
On the landing page, the user is greeted with a welcoming header and a form titled "What's on your mind." The form contains three fields: (Username: The user enters their name or desired username. Title: The user provides a title for their blog post. Content: The user writes the main content of their blog post.) After filling in the fields, the user clicks the "Submit" button. If any of the fields are left empty, an alert will prompt the user to complete all fields before proceeding. After submitting the form successfully, the blog post data (username, title, and content) is stored in the browser's localStorage. The user is then automatically redirected to the blog posts page. On the posts page, the user can see a list of all blog posts they and others have created. Each blog post displays Title (shown as a heading), Content (the main body of the post) and Username (the name of the post's author). The posts page includes a light/dark mode toggle button at the top. By clicking the toggle button, the user can switch between light and dark themes, adjusting the background and text colors for better readability and personal preference. A "Back" button on the posts page allows the user to return to the initial home page. From there, they can add new blog posts by repeating the form submission process.

At the bottom of the posts page, there is a footer with links to my portfolio and GitHub, as well as my email for contact information.
